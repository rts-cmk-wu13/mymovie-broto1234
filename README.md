Check out the live website here: [Netlify](https://themovie-db-app.netlify.app/)


- **Dynamic web:** The *document.createElement()* method is used in JavaScript to dynamically create a new HTML element via the DOM (Document Object Model).

- **Fetch API:** The goal of the assignment is to show list display and detail display using url parameters (*query strings*). It fetches all movies trending this week.

- **Dark mood:** The switch button in the upper right corner must switch between dark mode and light mode. The application must remember my preferred color choice (e.g. in *localStorage*), so that the user is presented with the same experience the next time the application is used.

## Skills:
